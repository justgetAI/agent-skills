# Marketing Copy Prompt

Write compelling marketing copy for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] that captures attention instantly and creates emotional resonance.

## Style References

- Channel the clear, direct writing style of Jason Fried
- Apply the principles from Dan Heath's "Made to Stick" — you have one shot to capture someone's attention
- Remember: the most memorable content opens with something striking and unexpected (like "I woke up in a bathtub full of ice and realized somebody had taken my kidney")

## Core Principles

1. **You only have a second to grasp somebody** — lead with the most compelling, specific claim possible
2. **Emotional resonance over feature lists** — make the reader *feel* something immediately
3. **Concrete specificity beats vague promises** — notice how "25 minutes" and "10 sessions" creates believability through precision
4. **Create a comparison that reframes value** — position the product against something familiar but show unexpected superiority

## Structure Guidelines

- Open with a headline that makes an audacious but believable promise
- Use specific numbers and timeframes to build credibility
- Create contrast between the old way and the new way
- Make the benefit viscerally understood, not just intellectually stated

## Example of the Technique in Action

Instead of: "Our app helps you understand yourself better"
Use: "In 25 minutes, you'll understand yourself better than a therapist would after 10 sessions"

The second version works because it:

- Gives a specific, short timeframe (25 minutes)
- Creates an unexpected comparison (vs. therapy)
- Makes a bold claim that provokes curiosity
- Implies massive time/money savings without stating it directly
