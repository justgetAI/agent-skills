- **Jason Fried's clarity** — direct, no fluff
- **Dan Heath's "Made to Stick"** — one shot to capture attention
- **Specificity > vagueness** — "25 minutes" beats "quickly"
- **Reframe value** — unexpected comparisons that shift perspective

## Quick Start

```
Write marketing copy for:
- Product: [your product]
- Audience: [who you're targeting]
- Transformation: [what changes for them]
```

## Example

**Before:** "Our app helps you understand yourself better"

**After:** "In 25 minutes, you'll understand yourself better than a therapist would after 10 sessions"
