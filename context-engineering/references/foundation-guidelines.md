# Foundation Guidelines

## What belongs in foundation/
- API contracts, data models, schemas
- Business logic rules
- Tech stack decisions
- Key findings from investigation
- Auth flows, integrations

## Authorship
- **Human-authored only** — agents read, never write directly
- Assumed correct unless evidence suggests otherwise
- Changes must be intentional, not accidental

## Discovery flow
1. Agent discovers something that should be in foundation
2. Agent notes in task's `## Discoveries` section
3. Human reviews task on completion
4. Human updates foundation if appropriate

## Philosophy
- Eliminate assumptions — reference foundation BEFORE doing work
- If foundation is wrong → flag it, don't work around it
- Concise > complete — keep signal high, skip filler
